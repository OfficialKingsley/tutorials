    <h3>useReducer hook</h3>
    <p>
      This is actually a replacement for the useState() hook. Both hooks
      actually have the same purpose. <br />
      However, in a situation where you have a trigger action (maybe a click
      event on a button) and this action is supposed to perform two or more
      events (i.e. change two or more states), you might consider the use
      reducer hook so that you don't have to create multiple states
    </p>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
import {useState} from react;

const ReducerTutorial= () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); //Notice that the useState() hook was used in the component
    const [showText, setShowText] = useState(true);

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{count}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;button 
            onClick={()=> {
                setCount(count + 1)
                setShowText(!showText)
            }}
            &gt;
                Increment
            &lt;/button&gt;

            {showText && &lt;p&gt;This is a text&lt;/p&gt;}
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )

}

      <code>
        <pre>
//The useReducer() hook accepts two parameters
//The first is a (reducer) function
//The second parameter is an object containing the states to be changed

//The useReducer returns an array containing the states and a function
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer_function, {states: defaultValues})


//The reducer function is defined outside of the component declaration
//It accepts two parameters
//The first parameter is the state object containing all the states we want to change
//The second parameter is an action parameter.
//This action parameter is actually passed by a dispatch function which calls the reducer function

//The second parameter is used to specify  the name of the action you want and what happens in the action
//The action parameter is also an object. To specify the type of action we use the switch statement


//The dispatch function is called this way
dispatch({type: "type_name"})
//It is usually called on an event
//Now we have one variable called state which contains all the states
//The state variable is an object
//The dispatch is a function that is called anytime we want to change a state. it's just like the setState function
//The dispatch function goes to the reducer function to find an action
