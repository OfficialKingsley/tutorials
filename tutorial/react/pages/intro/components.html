    <h1>Components</h1>
    <p>
      A component can simpoly be defined as a part of the app. It doesn't
      necessarily mean an html element. <br />
      For example, a blog of posts is a component, each post is also a
      component.
    </p>
    <p>
      These components are made up of html elements or other components in them
    </p>
    <p>
      Components can contain states. States are objects that determine how a
      component renders and behaves. e.,g a collapsible menu that will have a
      close and open state. You may have an state object that has a value of
      true or false. <br />
      State could also be defined as the data of a commponent
    </p>
    <p>
      Any data used in your component is part of state. You can share your
      states across multiple component using app state or global state. Some
      times you have many apps states that can get difficult to manage. You
      could react's context API or an external state manager like Redux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to react 16.8, we had to use class components if we wanted to hold
      state but in 16.8, hooks were introduced in function components to allow
      the use of states
