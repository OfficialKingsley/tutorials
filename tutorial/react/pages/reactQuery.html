    <p>
      React query is a library for fetching data in react. <br />
      Since react is a ui based library, there is no particular way for fetching
      data in react. <br />
      We usually use the useEffect hook and useState hook and if the data is
      needed, we use a state management library
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the state management libraries are good for working with client
      state like the theme for the application or whether a user is
      authenticated or not. <br />
      These libraries are not good for asynchronous code or server side state.
      This is because server state is different from client state
    </p>
    <p>
      Client state persists in your app memory and accessing the data is
      synchronous <br />
      In server state, the state persists remotely in a database perhaps and
      requires async api or data fetching to get this data. <br />
      For example, the search results from google. <br />
      Another thing to note is that server state has shared ownership i.e. it
      can be used in different applications and also, data can be updated by
      someone else without your knowledge which can lead to the UI data not
      being in sync with the remote data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This becomes even more challenging when you have to do with caching,
      deduping multiple requestss for the same data, updating stale data in the
      background, performance optimization when it comes to pagination and lazy
      loading etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      IF you want to resolve all the issues, it will be time consuming and you
      will have to do all that yourself. Or you can just use a library which is
      react query.

    <fieldset>
      <legend>In the app.js</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
import { QueryClientProvider and QueryClient} from "react-query";

function App () {
  cosnt queryClient = new QueryClient();
  return (
    &lt;QueryClientProvider client={queryCient}&gt;
      //Every other thing in the app
    &lt;/QueryClientProvider&gt;
  )
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
//Basic data fetching

import { useQuery } from "react-query"
//syntax = useQuery(
  key,
  () => {
    data-fetching-function-that-returns-a-promise
  })
export const RQSuperHeroesPage = () => {
  const {isLoading, data} = useQuery("super-heroes". ()=>{
    return axios.get("http://super-heroes.api.com/superheroes")
  })
  //The useQuery hook comes with the isLoading and data variables
  //So we destructured them out
  //data is the total response
  //data.data is the actual data

  //?. is known as the optional chaining method
  //data?.data
  //The above checks the first data so if it is not found it doesn't
  if (isLoading) {
  return &lt;div&gt;React Query Super Heroes&lt;/div&gt;
}
return (
  &lt;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;RQ super Heroes Page&lt;/h2&gt;
    {data?.data.map((hero)=>{
      return &lt;div key={hero.name}&gt;hero.name&lt;/div&gt;
    })}
  &lt;/&gt;
)
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      Another thing that can be done is that we use an external function to
      fetch the data and put the data in the useQuery hook.
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const fetchData = () => {
  axios.get("http://super-heroes.api.com/superheroes")
}
const RQSuperHeroespage = () => {
  const {isLoading, data} = useQuery("super-heroes", fetchData)
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Handling errors</h3>
    <p>
      The useQuery hook also returns an isError variable and an error from the
      api call. Therefore, we do not need to catch the error ourselves instead
      it is made available by react-query. <br />
      We can therefore destructure the error and isError from the useQuery hook
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const fetchData = () => {
  axios.get("http://super-heroes.api.com/superheroes")
}
const RQSuperHeroespage = () => {
  const {isLoading, data, isError, error} = useQuery("super-heroes", fetchData)
}
if (isLoading) {
  return &lt;div&gt;React Query Super Heroes&lt;/div&gt;
}
if (isError) {
  return &lt;div&gt;{error.message}&lt;/div&gt;
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      If there is an error, there is a higher waiting for data as react-query
      automatically retries to fetch the data from the api again and then if it
      is not found, it then returns the error message
    </p>
    <h3>React Query Dev tools</h3>
    <p>In the App.js we import react query dev tools</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "react-query/devtools"
//Then the last component of the in the App.js that is wrapped around the QueryClientProvider tag
function App () {
  cosnt queryClient = new QueryClient();
  return (
    &lt;QueryClientProvider client={queryCient}&gt;
      //Every other thing in the app
      &lt;ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} position="bottom-right"/>
    &lt;/QueryClientProvider&gt;
  )
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      The initialIsOpen attribute is set to false as we do not want the
      ReactQueryDevTools to be open initially
    </p>
    <p>The position prop sets the position of the ReactQueryDevtools button</p>

    <h3>Query Cache</h3>
    <p>
      When you navigate to a page in react, it fetches the data all over again
      irrespective of the number of times you open the link. However, if you
      open a link that its data was fetched with react-query, when you click the
      link again after you've left the page, it doesn't re-fetch the data again
      instead which makes UI and UX even better
    </p>
    <p>
      This action is as a result of the query cache provided by react-query.
      <br />
      By default, each query result has a temporary cache storage of about
      5mins. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time useQuery is fired, isLoading is set to true and a network
      request is sent to fetch the data. When the data is completed, it is
      cached with the query key and the function as the unique identifiers
    </p>
    <p>
      When ever we make a request, react-query will check if the data exists in
      cache and if it contains the data in the cache, the data is immediately
      rendered and the isLoading is not set to true. <br />
      Also, react-query knows that the data might be changed so it also runs a
      background re-fetch and passes the data to the component and if the data
      is the same as the cached data we do not see any change in the UI
    </p>
    <p>
      react-query also provides an isFetching flag (or variable) which is the
      boolean for the background fetching of data after the cached data has been
      passed to the component
    </p>
    <p>
      If we console.log({isLoading, isFetching}), when the request is made at
      first, both are true. When the data has been loaded, both then become
      false. <br />
      If the data is updated ( or not), we will see that the cached data is
      displayed in the UI first and in the console, isLoading is still false but
      isFetching is true. <br />
      If there's a change in data, the data will then be rendered to the UI and
      then we will see that isFetching is then set to false
    </p>
    <h3>Life of the cached data</h3>
    <p>
      By default, the cached data lasts for 5 minutes. To configure it, we can
      pass in a third argument to useQuery. <br />
      This third argument is an object contain configurations for different
      properties and cacheTime is one of them
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const fetchData = () => {
  axios.get("http://super-heroes.api.com/superheroes")
}
const RQSuperHeroespage = () => {
  const {isLoading, data, isError, error, isFetching} = useQuery("super-heroes",
  fetchData,
  {
    cacheTime:5000,
  })
}
//The unit of the time is in ms
if (isLoading) {
  return &lt;div&gt;React Query Super Heroes&lt;/div&gt;
}
if (isError) {
  return &lt;div&gt;{error.message}&lt;/div&gt;
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>stale time</h3>
    <p>
      If we do not want a backround fetch of data and we just want to use the
      cached data for a period of time, we configure a property called
      staleTime. <br />
      There will be no background data fetch for as long as that staleTime
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const fetchData = () => {
  axios.get("http://super-heroes.api.com/superheroes")
}
const RQSuperHeroespage = () => {
  const {isLoading, data, isError, error, isFetching} = useQuery("super-heroes",
  fetchData,
  {
    staleTime:30000,
  })
}
//The unit of the time is in ms
if (isLoading) {
  return &lt;div&gt;React Query Super Heroes&lt;/div&gt;
}
if (isError) {
  return &lt;div&gt;{error.message}&lt;/div&gt;
}
//The data still remains fresh in the react query dev tools
//After the stale time has elapsed,
//The background fetch will be if the link is clicked
//then the new data will still remain fresh again for anothe 30 seccs
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>refecthOnMount</h3>
    <p>
      This is a boolean in the onject passed in to useQuery. <br />
      By defult it is true and that is why the background refetch is triggered
      anytime we go to the route
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the property is a boolean value, we can also pass in the
      string "always" as its value. <br />
      What this does is that it will make sure on every mount of the page that
      the data is fetched even if a staleTime is set
    </p>
    <h3>refetchOnWindowFocus</h3>

    <h2>Polling data</h2>
    <p>
      This refers to fetching data at regular intervals. To do this, we use the
      refetchInterval in the object of the useQuery hook
    </p>
    <p>
      By default it is set to false (a boolean) but you can assign it to a
      number in milliseconds. So it will fetch the data after the specified
      interval. <br />
      However, it should be noted that when the window loses focus, this polling
      also stops. If you do not want it to stop, we set
      refetchIntervalInBackgroud to true
    </p>
    <h3>Events with useQuery</h3>
    <p>
      In this example, we are going to fetch data only when the button is
      clicked. <br />
      First, we set the enabled property of the useQuery object to false. <br />
      This will make sure the data won't be fetched on mount or focus
    </p>
    <p>
      To use an event like onClick, useQuery returns a function called refetch
      that we can destructure from it. This functions helps us to manually fetch
      data
    </p>
    &lt;button onClick={refetch}>&lt;/button>

    <h2>Callbacks in useQuery</h2>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const onSuccess = () => {
  console.log("This was a success so we want to do something else")
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      There are values that we call in the useQuery Object which are onSuccess
      and onError
    </p>
    <p>
      These two accept functions (call back) that will be called if there is
      either a success or an error
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing to note is that react-query will automatically pass in
      either the data or error to their specified functions as parameters
    </p>
    <h2>Data Transformation</h2>
    <p>in the useQuery</p>
    <fiedset>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  select: (response) => {
    const superHeroes = response.data.map(hero +> hero.name)
    return superHeroes
  }
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fiedset>
    <p>
      since the is put in the object of the usequery hook, it changes the data
      that was destructured to what we exported from the select property which
      in this case is superHeroes. <br />
      so whenever we call the data variable that was destructured, we are
      actually referring to the superHeroes array
    </p>
    <h2>customQuery</h2>
    <p>
      The above way is good especially for small apps. <br />
      in larger apps, we might to use the same data fetching in another
      component and this might lead us to duplicating the code and we know that
      it is not right to duplicate code <br />
      To fix this issue, we create custom query hooks that drags around the use
      useQuery
    </p>
    <p>Create a new file for custom Hooks</p>
    <p>
      After that we just move the code for the useQuery hook into the function
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre></pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Querying by Id</h3>
    <p>
      To query by id, we can actually just set the queryKey to an array with a
      name and a unique id like so: <br />
      <code>
        <pre
          contenteditable="false"
          style="
            border: 2px solid gray;
            background-color: black;
            color: white;
            padding: 5px;
            overflow-x: scroll;
          "
        >
["superHero", heroId]
<span class="comment" style="color: gray;">//This is a very very very very very very very long comment</span>
</pre>
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      You should note that the when you pass a function to the useQuery hook,
      the data gotten from the query is passed as an argument and we can access
      the queryKey from destructuring it
    </p>
    <h3>Parrallel queries</h3>
    <p>
      This is useful if we want to make different requests or fetch two sets of
      data from a page. These queries run independently and run on their own
    </p>
    <p>
      When destructuring and you do this, <br />
      <code>
        <pre>
const {data: superHeroes} = useQuery("super-heroes", fetchSuperHeroes)</pre
        >
      </code>
      <br />
      What you are doing is that you are setting the data which was destructured
      to superHeroes
    </p>
    <h3>Dynamic parallel queries</h3>
    <p>
      We need to import useQueries. This returns an array of queryResults
      useQueries containing the number of times the query was made
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
        export const DynamicParallelPage = ({heroIds}) => {
          const queryResults = useQueries(
            heroIds.map(id => {
              return {
                queryKey: ["super-hero", id]
                queryFn: () => fetchSuperHero(id)
              }
            })
          )
        }
      </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Dependent queries</h3>
    <p>
      You might need queries to be done sequentially i.e. one after the other.
      For example, we want to get the channels of a user. We have to first
      import the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thing i've learned... <br />
      Object chaning with ?. <br />
      Double negation !! which converts a value to a boolean
    </p>
    <h3>Initial queryData</h3>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
export const useSuperHeroData = heroId => {
  const queryClint = useQueryClient(); //Import the hook
  //The above actually has access to the cached data
  return useQuery(["super-hero", heroId], fetchSuperHero, {
    initialData: () => {
      const hero = queryClient.getQueryData("super-heroes")?.data?.find(hero => {
        hero.id === parseInt(heroId)
      }
      
      if(hero) {
        return {
          data: hero;
        }
      } else {
        return undefined
      })
    }
  })
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
  </body>
</html>
