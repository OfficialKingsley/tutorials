        <h2>URLs</h2>
        <p>
            A URL is just a basic way of identifying a unique resource on a site. A url could mean a unique blog in a
            blog post
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking amazon for example, when we go to amazon.com, we load the home page but if we click on a product, we
            see a relatively different link. This link is important as it always points to that product. So anytime we
            want to see that product, if we copy the exact link, it will always direct us to that product
        </p>
        <p>
            in SPAs, we don't refresh the page as it clears our state. This creates a problem as we never actually
            update the url because we are not going to different url because we are not sending a request to the backend
            server to get a new html document. Each resource on a website is actually assigned a url. In SPAs we don't
            link to different pages so we can't even bookmark the page as it still refers to the same html page <br />
            Another disadvantage of SPA is that we can't go back and forward to the pages we visited since it is still
            the same domain and the same index.html that we are loading
        </p>
        <h3>HTML history api</h3>
        <p>
            This helps us to get unique urls for each resource on our page so that our users can bookmark and have
            specific links to take them to that exact resource
        </p>
        <p>
            The history is an object of constructor History that has a state object which contains the id and another
            object in it called the
        </p>
        <p>
            Some methods include <code>go();</code>, <code>back();</code>, <code>forward();</code>,
            <code>pushState();</code>, <code>replaceState();</code> methods
        </p>
        <p>We can use this to navigate back and forth with its methods like go, forward and back</p>
        <p>To push or add a url to the history api, we use the push state method</p>
        <p>
            This is similar to the replace state in action but the replace state actually replaces the current url with
            the new one assigned to it. pushState increases the length of the history object while replace doesn't
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
//Syntax
//history.pushState({passed_data}.. "Title", "url that you want to fo to or add to state")
//The passed data is any data we will like to pass to the url that we are pushing to the state e.g.

//if we are on twitter.com,

history.push({}. "", "/leKing")

//It may look like nothing happened on the page but we changed the url if you look at the input field of the browser
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            React interacts with the history api, when we create a new Link element, react router goes to push a new
            state then the route looks for the script with that link or url and renders it
        </p>
        <p>
            React router dom has given us a way to interact with the history api using the hook called
            <code>useHistory();</code> <br />
            If we access the history object directly as in <code>window.history.go(-3) </code> for example, we'll see
            that we do not change the content on the page that is why the react-router-dom handles the change for us
            when we use the useHistory hook
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
const history = useHistory();

//It should however be noted that some of the methods are quite different like pushState is actually push.
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
