    <h3>Understanding URLs</h3>
    <p>A url consists of four major parts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First is the protocol. For example we http (hyper text transfrer
        protocol), https (for a secure website), ftp(file transfer protocol)
        etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Domain name or the IP address e.g. local host, 192.35.78.785. e.g.
        google.com is the domain name
      </li>
      <li>
        A port number like 3000. This port number usually comes after a colon
        after the domain name e.g.
        <pre>192.35.78.785:3000</pre>
        <br />
        By default, port numbers are not seen on browsers because by default we
        use port 443 for https sites and port 80 for http sites but when working
        on local servers, we usually use port 3000
      </li>
      <li>
        A then we have routes which usually come after backslashes e.g.
        /products, 192.35.78.785:3000/products, 192.35.78.785:3000/
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When we type a url and hit enter, we send a request to the sever hosting
      the site and when the server sees the route, it responds back with an html
      page that is associated with the route specified
    </p>
    <p>
      A multi-page app is one that has different pages and different html files
      practically. However, react creates what is known as a single page app
      which has one index,html so we have to use the react router to allow us to
      transform our react app to be like a multi page app and still maintain its
      single page application functionality
    </p>

    <h3>How multi application sites work</h3>
    <p>
      We have a browser (the client) and we have a server (the back end) <br />
      When we go to a route or to a link, we send a get request to the server
      which has multiple html files each associated with its own route. Then the
      server sends back a response with the appropriate html file and the user
      then loads this page and the html file is displayed
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in react, we have only one html file that is loaded to the page.
      So the web browser can only send the only html and no other file. When the
      html file is loaded, then the js takes over and then dynamically loads
      content on the html from the virtual dom
    </p>
    <p>
      So using a react app, if we for example want to go to the contact route,
      we send a request from the browser and then the server sends back the only
      html file which is the index.html then the react app then sees that the
      route is for the /contact page and then the react app loads the Contact.js
      component and displays it on the index.html
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if we also want to navigate to the /about route, we send a
      get request to the server. Well instead of sending the request to the
      server we send it to the react router. This is done because the server
      will always load the index.html which is already loaded to the page. So
      when the react router receives the request, it then tells react to load
      the About.js component instead of it sending back an index.html. <br />
      This method is nice as the page is not refreshed but the component is
      re-rendered. So the user never refreshes the page basically. So that's why
      it is called a single page application.
