    <h3>useState</h3>
    <p>
      The state of an element refers to all the characteristics of the elements.
      <br />
      The color, the values, the size, the UI etc. <br />
      It should however be noted that a state cannot be changed instead it can
      be recreated and re-rendered automatically to the browser. <br />
      For example if we are to create a counter app with a button, the counter
      will increase but won't show on the page. This is because we haven't told
      react to rerender the state of the counter when the button is clicked
    </p>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const StateTutorial = () => {
    let counter = 0;

    const increment = () => {
        counter += 1;
        console.log(counter)
    }

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            {counter}
            &lt;button onClick={increment}&gt;Increment&lt;button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}

export default StateTutorial;
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h4>useState</h4>
    <p>
      The useState hook is used to store the present state of an element and
      also gives a function to update itself (i.e. the state)
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
import {useState} from react;

const Component = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState(defaultValue) 

//The first item in the array is the name of the state
//The second item in that array is the name of the function that will update
//that paticular state
//Notice that the useState() hook was used in the component
}</pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
import {useState} from react;

const Component = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0) 
    
//Notice that the useState() hook was used in the component
//i.e. it wasn't declared outside the component declaration

const increment = () => {
counter += 1;
console.log(counter)
    //using the above method will cause an error because state cannot be changed
    //Instead we use the function for updating it which is the setCount function as follows

    setCount(count + 1)
}

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            {counter}
            &lt;button onClick={increment}&gt;Increment&lt;button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <p>
      Note that when using the useState() hook, you have to make sure that when
      setting the state with the setState function you have to make sure that
      the datatype that you are setting it to is equal to the data type of the
      initial value
    </p>
