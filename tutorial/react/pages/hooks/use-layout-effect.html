    <h3>useLayoutEffect hook</h3>
    <p>
      This is very similar to the useEffect but there is a very slight
      difference. If you write a code to log out something both with useEffect
      and useLayoutEffect you'll see that the one with the useLayoutEffect will
      be done first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between the two is that useEffect is called after the page
      has been rendered and then rerenders the page. However the useLayoutEffect
      is called well before the page is rendered. It can be used for something
      like showing the default values.
