    <h3>useRef hook</h3>
    <p>
      This hook is the easiest way to access dom elements<br />
      This hook is used when you want to focus on an input whenever an action is
      taken. <br />
      Normally is react, we do not have to access dom elements because of the
      virtual dom. However, there are some situations where you would need to
      manipulate or at least add some functionality to certain dom elements and
      the useRef helps in that
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the useRef hook, the element that we want to access must have a ref
      attribute
    </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
import {useRef} from "react";

const RefTutorial = () => {
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    const clickEvent = () => {
        console.log(inputRef.current.value); //Notice that we had to access the current value
    }

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Pedro&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Some random text here ref={inputRef}/&gt; 
            //You pass in the name of the created ref created using the useRef hook
            &lt;button onClick={clickEvent}&gt;Change Name&lt;button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}
                </pre
        >
