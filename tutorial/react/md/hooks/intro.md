# React Hooks

Hooks are special functions that allow us to do things inside functional components that normally would be only done in class based components. For example using state which was used only in class based components

In react, if we want to change the value of an element, you don't need to get the element (like `document.querySelector("#someId")`) which is one of the advantages of react. You just need to write the code in the element
