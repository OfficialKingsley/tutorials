# Introduction to React

React is a front-end library for building interfaces. It runs on the client
(or browser) as a Single Page Application(SPA) but can be used to build full
stack apps by communicating with a server/API (e.g. the `MERN` stack)

React is a library but most times referred to as a framework because it is capable and directly comparable to a framework such as angular or vue

If you install some functionalities in react, you can make it act as a framework

## Advantages of react

---

- It helps you to structure the view layer of your application. MVC (Model View Controller) is a popular design pattern for software. Model is data, controller is the requesting of data and routing. The view is the UI. React is the view in MVC

- React gives you already predefined reusable components for building your UI

- We don't have to separate our markup from our logic because react uses something called `JSX` extension and this allows us to write HTML

- Apps in React are very reactive because it uses what is known as a virtual DOM. This allows you to update the page without having to reload the page. It changes only what needs to be changed in the real DOM

- Very Popular

- Managing data
