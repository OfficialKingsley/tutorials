    <h1>React Context API</h1>
    <p>
      React context helps us with an easy and clean way to share state without
      passing props down even to the components that do not need the props. This
      thereby makes react cleaner and easier<br />
      The components that don't use the props act as carrier components for the
      props <br />
      Using react with hooks the context api helps us to get something relative
      to redux. <br />
      You can share state within a component tree. <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Examples and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      To use the context api, we have to first create a context then we make
      this context available to the component tree where it might be needed
      <br />
      To make it available or (known as providing it) using a context provider
      which is a react tag. We wrap the tree where we will need this data in the
      context provider element and then any element in the tree can access the
      context state.
    </p>
    <h2>When to use the context</h2>
    <p>
      It is advised to use the context api when the state to be shared can be
      considered as global or will likely be used by a lot of components. For
      example, a theme, a current authenticated user, preferred language.
    </p>
    <h2>Consuming a context</h2>
    <p>This simply means accessing the data in the context</p>
