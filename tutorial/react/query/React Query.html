    <h2>React query</h2>
    <p>
      What is the meaning of querying. When you use the fetch api, you're the
      browser cache. The concept of cache is not
    </p>
    <p>
      React query is like this caching layer that just lives inside the memory
      of your application. It doesn't take over the responsibility of using the
      right headers and doserving er side and browser level caching. It's more
      of a cache that improves the user experience and fill in some of those
      gaps. It used to improve user experience and developer experience. <br />
      React just need to know your promise <br />
      caching <br />
      hydrating the react app when it gets to a client<br />
      You fetch data into a cache and you send that cache with your html to your
      client and then you hydrate the client
    </p>

    <h3>Let's start</h3>
    <p>
      Nobody wants to see an application where everything you click has to load
      especially when you're developing applications
    </p>
    <h3>Queries</h3>
    <p>In react-query we have a hook called useQuery</p>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
import { useQuery } from "react-query";
//useQuery(identifier, async_function)
//return(
  "posts",
  ()=>axios.get("this.api.com"));
//The identifier is the name of the thing you are fetching
//The async function is a function that fetches your data
//and returns an error if an error is found
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      The useQuery handles the state and reducers of your async work and
      react-query also handles the life cycle around all of your fetching
    </p>
    <p>
      useQuery returns an object containing everything like the status enums, it
      has booleans, data property, error
    </p>
    <p>
      What it does is that. If you've visited a page before, since it has been
      loaded, it won't load again. It instantly gets your data. So it keeps your
      data in a cache in your html so when you open the page, we see that the it
      automatically loads
    </p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      React query is a library for fetching. Since react is a UI library, ther
      is no specific pattern for data fetching
    </p>
