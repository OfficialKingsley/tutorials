    <h3>Paths</h3>
    <p>
      When defining paths in a route, if we can specify a page (or pages) that
      do not exist in our routes. To do this, the path attribute should have a
      value of "*". This value says that any path that is not specified in the
      above routes should be this page. This is usually used for wrong urls or
      and error messages. It used in creating page not found
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also specify some path characteristics. To do this, we use the
      sign "/:" in the path attribute followed by a variable name
    </p>
