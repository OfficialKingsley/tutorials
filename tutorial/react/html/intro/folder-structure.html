    <h2>Folders</h2>
    <p>
      When you install your react, there are some folders that come with it
      which include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        node_modules folder. This folder contains all your dependencies and all
        the libraries that were installed
      </li>
      <li>
        public (folder): This contains our index.html which is also the single
        page for the react app. Since react is a single page application, we
        have just one html file. <br />
        In the public folder we also have other items like our favicon etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        src (folder): This is where we put all our components and states and
        anything that has to do with our app. It contains the index.js, app.js
        and the css
      </li>
      <li>.gitignore file</li>
      <li>
        package.json: This contains all the dependencies and features that come
        with create react app
      </li>
      <li>README.md</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the index.js, we import React from 'react'. We also import ReactDOM
      from 'react-dom' It is here that we import our css and the App from
      './App'
    </p>
    <p>
      The ReactDOM has a render component. which renders the components to the
      browser
    </p>
