    React is a front-end library for building interfaces. It runs on the client
    (or browser) as a Single Page Application(SPA) but can be used to build full
    stack apps by communicating with a server/API (e.g. the MERN stack)
    <p>
      React is a library but most times referred to as a framework because it is
      capable and directly comparable to a framework such as angular or vue
    </p>
    <p>
      If you install some functionalities in react, you can make it act as a
      framework

    <h3>Advantages of react</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It helps you to structure the view layer of your application. MVC (Model
        View Controller) is a popular design pattern for software. Model is
        data, controller is the requesting of data and routing. The view is the
        UI. React is the view in MVC
      </li>
      <li>
        React gives you already predefined reusable components for building your
        UI
      </li>
      <li>
        We dont have to separate our markup from our logic because react uses
        something called JSX extension and this allows us to write HTML
      </li>
      <li>
        Apps in React are very reactive because it uses what is known as a
        virtual DOM. This allows you to update the page without having to reload
        the page. It changes only what needs to be changed in the real DOM
      </li>
      <li>Very Popular</li>
      <li>Managing data</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What you should know</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Data types variables, functions loops etc</li>
      <li>Promises and async programming</li>
      <li>Array methods like <code>foEach();</code> and <code>map();</code></li>
      <li>fetch API and HTTP requests</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In react, we think of every part of the app as a component. We shouldn't
      make the mistake of thinking an html tag is a component. They are two
      different things <br />
      In react almost every part is a component. A button is a component. the
      tweets section is a component. Each tweet in the tweets section is
    </p>

    <p>In react, each component could be either a function or a class</p>
