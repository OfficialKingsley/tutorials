    <h3>useEffect</h3>
    <p>
      This is a function called whenever any item in the page re-renders. <br />
      It is also powerful because you can call it only when specific states are
      re-rendered. <br />
      You can also specify that it should be called once on first load of the
      page
    </p>

    <fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Called every time the page re-renders a state</legend>
        <code>
          <pre>
useEffect(()=> {
    //Do something
})
                    </pre
          >
        </code>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Called when a specific state is changed</legend>
        <code>
          <pre>
useEffect(()=> {
    //Do something when the state called hello is re-rendered.
}, [hello])
//Notice the use of the an array to hold the specific states
//These specific states are called the dependencies
//And the array is called a dependency array
                    </pre
          >
        </code>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Called first on page load</legend>
        <code>
          <pre>
useEffect(()=> {
    //Do something when the state called hello is re-rendered.
}, [])
//Notice the use of the an array that has no values
//So after the first time it is called, it doesn't render again
                    </pre
          >
        </code>
