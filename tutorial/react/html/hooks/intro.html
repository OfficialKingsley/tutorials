      Hooks are special functions that allow us to do things inside functional
      components that normally would be only done in class based components. For
      example using state which was used only in class based components

      In react, if we want to change the value of an element, you don't need to
      get the element (like document.querySelector("#someId")) which is one of
      the advantages of react. You just need to write the code in the element
