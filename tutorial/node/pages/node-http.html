    <h1>Creating HTTP servers with node js</h1>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req, res)=>{
  req - request - this is what the client requests from the server
  After we get the response we can get send back a response
  res.write("Hello world from js"); This is the response we wanna send
  res.end() Now, we've sent the response
})

//To start the server
//server.listen(port-number)
server.listen("3000")
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const server = http.createServer((req, res)=>{
  if (req.url === "/") {
//The url property represents the route of the request
    res.write("Hello world from js"); This is the response we wanna send
    res.end() Now, we've sent the response
  }

  //We said if the route is the home route then we should show that text 

  
  
})
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <h3>Serving Static Files with Http and File system modules</h3>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");
const server = http.createServer((req, res)=> {
  const readStream =fs.createReadStream("./static/index.html")
  res.writeHead(200, {
    "Content-type": "text/html"
  });
  readStream.pipe(res)

  //The res is also a writable stream
})
server.listen(3000)

//Content types
//html- text/html
//json - applicaion/json
//image/png
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <h3>Creating a package.json with npm init</h3>
    <p>The package.json holds all the meta data for our app. The meta data</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
//in the terminal

npm init

This will bring out a set of options to fill like
package_name
version
description
entry point: This tells us which file to start out node application
//Just like the index.js in react
test command
git repository
keywords
author
license

Is this ok? (yes)

        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <h3>Installing packages with nom</h3>
    <p>A package can be defined as a folder with modules in it</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
npm i package_name

//in the package.json, you will see a new property called dependencies
"dependencies": {
  "package_name": "package_version"
}

//Another folder called node_modules is where all the downloaded dependencies can be found

To use the node_module all you need to do is to just require it

//to uninstall a module, you can just type

npm uninstall package_name
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Semantic Versioning</h3>
    <p>This is a standard that node packages follow</p>
    <p>
      In the package version e.g. if the version of loadash is <br />
      "^4.17.11" <br />
      //They represent major_version.minor_version.patch_version
    </p>
    <p>
      If the patch version changes that means that there was a patch update and
      that they implementedsome bug fixes. <br />
      If the minor update occurs, new functionality has been added and old
      functionality has been deprecated but the old functionality can still be
      used <br />
      If the major_version is changed, that means there was a breaking change.
      Tha <br />
      <br />
      The caret (^) character infront of the number tells npm to install the
      latest versions of the package as long as its still the main version. So
      if there's any update in the minor version or patch version, it will be
      updated but not the major version <br />
      The tilder (~) This means you want only the patch update <br />
      And if none of those signs are used, there will be no update
    </p>
