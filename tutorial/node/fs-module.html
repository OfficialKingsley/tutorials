    <h3>File system module</h3>
    <p>This helps us to work with files and folders</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const fs = require("fs");

//Create a file
//syntax
fs.writeFile("filename.extension", "Content of file", (error)=>{
  //do something with the error
  if (error) {
    console.log("There was an error")
  } else {
    //do something else
  }
})
fs.writeFile("example.txt", "This is an example", (err)=>{
  if (err)
    console.log(err);
  else {
    console.log("The new file was created")
    //To read the file
    fs.readFile("example.txt", "UTF-8",(err, file)=>{
      //If you don't pass in the encoding type,
      //It will output something in buffer-binary state
      //&lt;Buffer 75 64 7c> ...
      <!--  -->
      if (err) {
        console.log(err)
      } else {
        console.log(file)
      }
    })
  }    
})

//To rename a file

fs.rename("example.txt", "example2.txt", (err)=>{
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    console.log(successfully renamed the file)
  }
})

//To append data

fs.appendFile("example2.txt", "Some data being appended", (err)=>{
  if (err) {

  } else {
    successfully appended data
  }
})

//To delete the file

fs.unlink("example2.txt", (err)=> {
  if (err) {

  } else {
    successfully deleted the file
  }
})
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h4>Working with folders</h4>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
fs.mkdir("tutorial", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    console.log("folder successfully created")
  }
})

fs.rmdir("tutorial", (err) => {
  if (err) {

  } else {
    successfully deleted folder
  }
})

//To make a file in a folder

fs.writeFile("./tutorial/example.txt", "123", (err)=>{
  if () {

  } else {

  }
})

//To delete a folder with something in it,
//Do not use rmdir because this only works for empty folders

//You have to first delete the file before you can delete the the folder

//If you want to delete multiple files,

fs.readdir("example", (err, files)=>{
  //files is gonna be an array
  if (err) {

  } else {
    files

    //You can then use a for loop to delete a file
  }
})
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <h3>Readable and Writable Streams</h3>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("./example.txt","utf-8");
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("./example.txt");
//This stream wil create and write into in when ever it is called

readStream.on("data", (chunk)=>{
  console.log(chunk)
  writeStream.write(chunk)
})

Working with chunk is better as you don't have to wait for
the whole file to load before you start working with data.

//Also, the stream helps to load large files 
//as you read the in chunks since it uses smaller buffer sizes
//It is space efficient
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Pipes</h3>
    <p>This helps us to</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
readStream.on("data", (chunk)=>{
  console.log(chunk)
  writeStream.write(chunk)
})
//Is the same as

readStream.pipe(writeStream)
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Pipe Chaining</h3>
    <p>zlib is a module for compressing files</p>
    <p>
      A transformed stream takes an input and manipulates the data into
      something else
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const zlib = require("zlib")
const gzip = zlib.createGzip(); This will return the transformed stream

readStream.pipe(gzip).pipe(writeStream);

/The above will get the data then the gzip will transform it (or compress it)
//The it will be piped to the writeStream

//However note that the write stream will have a different extension
//as the data that you are passing into it is no longer a txt file
//const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("example.txt.gz")
//.gz is the file extension
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const zlib = require("zlib")
const gunzip = zlib.createGunzip();
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("./example2.txt.gz")
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("uncompressed.txt")
readStream.pipe(gunzip).pipe(writeStream)
        </pre>
