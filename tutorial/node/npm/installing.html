        <h3>Installing packages with nom</h3>
        <p>A package can be defined as a folder with modules in it</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
npm i package_name

//in the package.json, you will see a new property called dependencies
"dependencies": {
    "package_name": "package_version"
}

//Another folder called node_modules is where all the downloaded dependencies can be found

To use the node_module all you need to do is to just require it
        </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <h3>Semantic Versioning</h3>
        <p>This is a standard that node packages follow</p>
        <p>
            In the package version e.g. if the version of loadash is <br />
            "^4.17.11" <br />
            //They represent major_version.minor_version.patch_version
        </p>
        <p>
            If the patch version changes that means that there was a patch update and that they
            implemented some bug fixes. <br />
            If the minor update occurs, new functionality has been added and old functionality has
            been deprecated but the old functionality can still be used <br />
            If the major_version is changed, that means there was a breaking change. Tha <br />
            <br />
            The caret (^) character in front of the number tells npm to install the latest versions
            of the package as long as its still the main version. So if there's any update in the
            minor version or patch version, it will be updated but not the major version <br />
            The tilder (~) This means you want only the patch update <br />
            And if none of those signs are used, there will be no update
        </p>
