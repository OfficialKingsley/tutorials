# Introduction to sass

Sass could be said to be css on steroids ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ or as its website likes to put it:

> CSS with superpowers

It basically extends CSS to improve CSS by adding features to making styles more flexible, easier to read and to reuse by adding programming constructs like `functions`, `loops`, `variables` and `inheritance`

It also adds features like rule nesting invisible comments and so many other stuff

It is very popular and was used to create some popular css libraries like **_bootstrap_**

To be able to use sass/scss, you need to compile it into css as the browser doesn't understand sass but understands css. Just like typescript is to javascript
