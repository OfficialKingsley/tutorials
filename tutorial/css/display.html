        <p>The display property has values of inline block inline-block flex grid etc.</p>
        <p>
            inline elements actually have a width of the content which the contain. Margin top and
            bottom is not really applied to them <br />
            To add a margin top or margin bottom, you have to set the display property to <br />
            <code>inline-block</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Block level elements on the other hand occupy the full width of the screen except if the
            width is explicitly defined. <br />
            If the width is explicitly defined, and you would like to center the element, you can
            type: <br />
            <code
                >margin: 0(or any value of your choice for top and bottom) auto(for the left and
                right)</code
            >
            <br />
            The above code will center it
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>display: none;</code>This will completely remove the element from the flow of the
            document. <br />
            <code>opacity: 0;</code>This will hide the element or make the element transparent but
            the element will still be in the flow of the document
            <code>visibility: hidden;</code> Almost the same as <code>opacity: 0;</code>
