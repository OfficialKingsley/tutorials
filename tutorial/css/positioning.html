        The possible values for the position property are:
        <ul>
            <li>Static (default)</li>
            <li>
                absolute: Positions itself relative to its parent which must have a position of
                relative and if it has no parent like that, it will position itself relative to the
                main document
            </li>
            <li>
                relative: This positions itself to its original position i.e. if it was 20px from
                the right in the default flow. Once it is set to relative, we can use the right,
                left, top and right properties to position relative to that original value
            </li>
            <li>fixed: This positions itself relative to the body element or the main document</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All the above except the static position can be manipulated using the top, right, bottom
            and left properties
        </p>
    </body>
