            The box-sizing of border box helps so that when padding is added to the element and a
            width is specified, the padding doesn't add extra width to the element <br />
            For example, if the width is 200px and we add a padding of 10px, the width of the total
            box will then increase to about 220px because the padding has added to the width <br />
            However, if the box-sizing is set to border-box, the width of that box will still be
            200px width the padding included in it
