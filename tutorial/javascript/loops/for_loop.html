    <h3>The For Loop</h3>
    <p>
      The for loop is often the tool you will use when you want to create a
      loop. The for loop has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    //code block to be executed
}
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts. So
          that statement 1 is usually an assignment of the iterator to a value
          (since it is run before the loop starts)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop (the code block).
        That means the loop will keep running as long as that condition is true
      </li>
      <li>
        Statement 3 is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has
        been executed. It is usually an increment so that we keep increasing the
        value till a point where the condition becomes false <br />
        It should also be noted that the loop will stop after each item in the
        list has been iterated over
      </li>
    </ol>

    <fieldset>
      <legend>Example</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    text += "The number is " + i + " ";
}
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0). <br />
      Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than
      5). <br />
      Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop
      has been executed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Statement 1 Normally you will use statement 1 to initiate the variable
      used in the loop (let i = 0). This is not always the case, JavaScript
      doesn't care <br />
      Statement 1 is optional. You can initiate many values in statement 1
      (separated by comma):
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Example</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
for (i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i &lt; len; i++) { <br />
    text += cars[i] + ""; <br />
}
                </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      And you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the
      loop starts):
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Example</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
var i = 2; 
var len = cars.length; 
var text = ""; 
for (; i &lt; len; i++) { 
    text += cars[i] + ""; 
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h4>Statement 2</h4>
    <p>
      Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial
      variable. This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement
      2 is also optional. If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over
      again, if it returns false, the loop will end.
    </p>
    <strong>Note</strong> If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break
    inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your
    browser.
    <h4>Statement 3</h4>
    <p>
      Often statement 3 increases the initial variable. This is not always the
      case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive
      increment <code>(i = i + 15)</code>, or anything else.
    </p>
    Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside
    the loop):
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Example</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
var i = 0; 
var len = cars.length; 
for (; i < len; ) { 
    text += cars[i] + ""; i++; 
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
  </body>
