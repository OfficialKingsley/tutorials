        Abstraction means hiding the details and complexity and show the essentials
        <h3>Private properties and methods</h3>
        This involves using the let to declare variables in JS.
        <h3>Difference between closure and scope</h3>
        Closure is for inner functions being able to access variables in the parent function. Scope
        is only showing how accessible the variable is. A local variable is one declared within a
        function and can't be accessed outside the function.
        <h5>Create a function to get</h5>
        <code
            >Object.defineProperty(objectName, "propertyName", get: function () { return
            defaultLocation; //This is now a read only property }, set)</code
        >
