        <h1>Classes</h1>
        <p>
            Classes are used to make objects. They are like constructors. An object could be defined
            as a creation from a class
        </p>
        <p>
            These objects can have (instance) properties. These are the properties that the object
            has. These properties can be defined using the class.
            <br />
            For example, a human being has properties like hands, legs, eyes, name, age, height etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            These objects also have what we call (instance) methods. These arae functions or
            possible actions of the object. <br />For example, a human can eat, run, walk etc.
        </p>
        <p>These properties are unique to any object that is created from the class definition</p>

        <h3>Creating a class</h3>
        <p>To create a class we use the class keyword</p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Syntax</legend>
            <code>
                <pre>
class ClassName {
    //class definition
}
            </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>When naming classes, we make the first letter uppercase</p>

        <h3>Class constructor</h3>
        <p>
            A constructor can be defined as a method which is ran only once during the life of the
            object. It only runs once and it is ran when the object is being created from the class.
            <br />
            A constructor can also be said to be a function to setup the object from the class
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
class Rectangle {
    constructor () {
        console.log("The rectangle is being created")
    }
}
            </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>

        To create an object from the class, we do:
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
let objectName = new ClassName;
            </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>For example,</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
let myRectangle = new Rectangle(); //Notice the parentheses.
//That is the effect of the constructor
            </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            If you have read our notes on constructor functions you'll see that a constructor is a
            function used to create an object
        </p>

        <p>we can specify the object properties in the constructor method</p>
        <p>
            To create a property we use the "this" keyword like so: <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>this.propertyname = value;</code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            The this keyword refers to the current object or the object that has been created with
            the class
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
class Rectangle {
    constructor () {
        console.log("An object is being created");

        this.width = 5;
        this.height = 3;
        this.color = "blue"
    }
}


let myRectangle = new Rectangle();
//Now we can access these properties using the dot notation;

console.log(myRectangle.width)

//Output: 5;
            </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>

        <p>
            Usually, what you will want to do is to make the user specify how he or she wants the
            rectangle to be
        </p>
        <p>To do this, we have to specify parameters in the constructor function or method</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
  class Rectangle {
      constructor (width, height, color) {
          console.log("An object is being created");
  
          this.width = width;
          this.height = height;
          this.color = color;
      }
  }
  
  
  let myRectangle = new Rectangle(5, 3, b"blue");
  //Now we can access these properties using the dot notation;
  
  console.log(myRectangle.width)
  
  //Output: 5;
              </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>To create a method, you can do this</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
getArea () {
    return this.width * this.height
}

Rectangle1.getArea();
</pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>

        <h2>Getters and setters in classes</h2>
        <p>
            These are used to define methods on a class which are then used as if they are
            properties
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
class Square {
  constructor (width) {
      this.width = width;
      this.height = width;
  }
  //Creating  a Getters
  get area () {
      return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const mySquare = new Square(5);

console.log(mySquare.area);
//See that we don't need to use parentheses
//This outputs 25
            </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>

        <p>Similar to getters, we have setters which allow us to assign new values to the object</p>

        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
class Square {
  constructor (width) {
      this.width = width;
      this.height = width;
  }
  //Creating  a Getters
  get area () {
      return this.width * this.height;
  }

  set area(area) {
      this.width = Math.sqrt(area);
      this.height = this.width;
  }
}

const mySquare = new Square(4);
//This outputs 25

mySquare.area = 25 //Now we are setting it
console.log(this.width, this.height)
//Output: 5, 5
              </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>

        <h2>Static methods</h2>
        <p>
            This is a method that you define in a class but it is not part of the instance methods.
            They are also called helper methods. You don't need an instance of the object to use the
            helper method. They don't have an object bound to them
        </p>
        <p>
            These methods are called on the constructor or on the class itself and not on the
            objects created by the class
        </p>

        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
class Square {
    constructor (width) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = width;
    }
}

static equals (a, b) {
    //Checks if the squares are of equals
    //Width and height

    return a.width === b.width; 
}

let mySquare = new Square(8);
let mySquare2 = new Square(5);

console.log(Square.equals(mySquare, mySquare2));

//Output false

//let mySquare = new Square(5);
//let mySquare2 = new Square(5);
//console.log(Square.equals(mySquare, mySquare2));
//Output: true;
                </pre>
            </code>
