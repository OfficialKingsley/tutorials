    <h2>Factory functions</h2>
    <p>
      When an object has one or more methods, it has a behavior. Creating an
      object with object literals may be an issue if it has methods. Also if you
      want to duplicate an object, you will have to re-write the code or copy
      and paste over and over again.
      <br />
      To solve this issue, we can define functions for creating objects. These
      functions are generally divided into two which are Factories and
      Constructors
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <legend></legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
function createCircle (rad) {
    return {
        radius: rad,
        draw:function() {
            console.log("draw")
        }
    }
}
        </pre>
      </code>
      <code> const circle = createCircle(1) </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset class="constructor">
      <legend>constructor</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
function Circle(rad) {
    this.radius = rad, //Notice the this keyword
    this.draw = function() {
        console.log("draw")
    }
}
                </pre
        >
      </code>
      <code> const anotherCircle = new Circle(1); </code>
    </fieldset>
    Every object in JS has a property called constructor which shows the
    function used to create the object. Even functions ini JavaScript also have
    constructors

    <h3>New properties to objects</h3>
    <p>
      <code>circle.location = { x: 1};</code>
    </p>
    You can delete an object property using the delete keyword

    <h3>Looping through an object with the for in loop</h3>

    <h3>General Object Methods</h3>
    <code>const keys = Object.keys(name of object)</code>
    The above produces an array of all the properties and methods The above
    produces an array of all the properties and methods

    <h3>The in operator</h3>
    if ("radius" in circle)
