    <p>
      In the switch statement, the key is a particular expression. It could be a
      condition or a value <br />
      In switch statements, you can have many cases. What a case does is that
      for every case, there is a value; so the case statement checks if that
      value is equal to the key or is equal to the value returned by the key (if
      the key is a condition)
      <br />
      Once the value equals the key, it runs the code in its block and then we
      put the break statement. <br />
      <br />
      The reason the break statement is put is so that after the code in the
      block has been executed, it doesn't go on to run other codes. If the break
      statement is not put, after the condition has been met, any other case
      below it will be executed
      <br />
      <br />
      Now to the default statement. This statment is put so that if none of the
      case value match the key, then the code in the default statement will be
      ran
