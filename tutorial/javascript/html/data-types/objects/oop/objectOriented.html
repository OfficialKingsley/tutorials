    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <p>
      This is a <strong>paradigm</strong> (or style) of programming that is
      centered around objects rather than functions
    </p>
    <h2>Pillars of object oriented programming</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before object oriented programming, there was procedural programming that
      had to deal with a lot of functions. We had variables and functions
      separately and is usually the basic of programming language that you
      learn. <br />
      In object oriented programming, we define an object and define functions
      (known and methods) for the object. and we also define variables(known as
      properties) in the object. The process of doing this is
      <mark><strong>ENCAPSULATION</strong></mark>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this we can say that functions perform actions whileproperties return
      values
    </p>

    For Example,
    <fieldset class="code">
      <legend>Procedural</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
let baseSalary = 30000;
let overtime = 10; 
let rate = 20; 
function getWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate) {
  return baseSalary + (overtime + rate); 
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset class="code">
      <legend>Object Oriented</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>
let employee = {
  baseSalary: 30000, 
  overtime: 10 
  rate: 20, 
  getWage: function() { 
    return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate);
  }
};
employee.getWage()
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    Abstraction: This involves having some properties that are not going to be
    in use. This is helpful as these parameters can be changed or even deleted
    and since they were not defined outside the object or were not called they
    do not affect the work flow.
    <p>
      Abstraction means hiding the details and complexity and show the
      essentials
    </p>
    <h3>Private properties and methods</h3>
    <p>This involves using the let to declare variables in JS.</p>
    <h3>Difference between closure and scope</h3>
    <p>
      Closure is for inner functions being able to access variables in the
      parent function. Scope is only showing how accessible the variable is. A
      local variable is one declared within a function and can't be accessed
      outside the function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inheritance: This allows you to eliminate redundant code as an element can
      inherit properties from a parent
    </p>
    <p>Polymorphism: This helps you get rid of excess conditional statements</p>
