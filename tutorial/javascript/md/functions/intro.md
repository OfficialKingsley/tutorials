# Introduction to functions

A function is a code designed to perform a specific task. <br />
A javascript function only executes if it has been called or invoked.

## Defining a function

---

In javascript, functions can be defined using the `function` keyword.

```js
function nameOfFunction () = {
//Code to be executed when the function is called
}
```

## Invoking a function

When you create a function, you have to call (or invoke) that function for it to be able to run

To invoke or call a function, all you need do is to write the function name with parentheses. e.g.

```js
function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello world");
}

myFunction(); //Here the function has been called
```
