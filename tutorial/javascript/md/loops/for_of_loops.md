# The for of loop

This is the loop used to loop over arrays

```js
const arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"];

for (letter of alphabets) {
  console.log(letter);
}
//This will print out the letters of the array one by one
```

In the above, we are calling our iteration variable letter because that is a descriptive name for it. You can actually call it what ever you want
