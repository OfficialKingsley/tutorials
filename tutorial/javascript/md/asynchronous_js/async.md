# Introduction To Asynchronous Javascript

What is an asynchronous function? <br />
This is a function that runs on its own. It doesn't have to wait for any
other function before it loads.
<br />
For example, if we have a synchronous system, the functions have to be executed one after the other. If one of the processes fails, the others will stop. However, in an asynchronous system, these functions or parameters don't depend on the other. They work independently
