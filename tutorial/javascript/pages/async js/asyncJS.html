      What is an asynchronous function? <br />
      This is a function that runs on its own. It doesn't have to wait for any
      other function before it loads.
      <br />
      For example, if we have a synchronous system, the functions have to be
      executed one after the other. If one of the processes fails, the others
      will stop. However, in an asynchronous system, these functions or
      parameters don't depend on the other. They work independently
    </p>
    <h2>Promise</h2>
    <p>
      A promise object in JS is an object that contains a producing code and
      calls to the consuming code
    </p>
    <p>
      The producing code is the code that can take some time. The producing code
      produces an output
    </p>
    <p>
      The consuming code is the code that must wait for the results. The
      consuming code then waits for the output of the producing code to then do
      something with it
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
  let myPromise = new Promise (function (myResolve, myReject)) {
    //This is the "producing code " which may take some time
    myResolve(); //This is called when it the promise is successful 
    myReject()//This is called when the code results in an error}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <code>
        <pre>
//Now the consuming code is the one that has to wait for
//the promise to be fulfilled or rejected
myPromise.then(function(value) { 
  code if there's no error
}, 
function(for if not resolved){} 
})
</pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>

    <h2>Promise Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      Assuming you have a restaurant, and a customer comes in. You make a
      promise of serving him food. If he has not yet made any order, the promise
      is still pending. Once a customer makes an order, you have to resolve the
      promise. Resolving the promise is either fulfilling it (if you have the
      ingredients)or rejecting the promise(if you don't have the ingredients).
      <br />
      This whole process is the producing code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processes that occur after this "producing code" depend on whether the
      promise was fulfilled or rejected. Since they depend on the result of the
      promise or they await the results of the promise, this is the consuming
      code the .thens
    </p>
    <p>
      If the promise was fulfilled, we move on to make the food that's where the
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
  let makeFood = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (hasIngredients === true) {
      resolve(startProduction()); 
    } else { 
      reject("Error"); 
    } 
  });
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>Now we move on to the consuming code</p>
      <code
        ><pre>
makeFood
.then( function (//If resolved,) {
  continueProduction()
},
function (error //if rejected)
)
        </pre></code
      >
    </fieldset>

    <h1>Async _ await</h1>
    <p>
      This provides a simpler way of creating promises. The "async" keyword
      applied to a function creates a new promise. The await keyword in the
      async function makes the function wait for the promise to be fulfilled
    </p>

    <fieldset>
      <code> async function myFunction() { return "Hello"; } </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The above is the same as...</p>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        async function myFunction() { return Promise.resolve("Hello"); }
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>Just like using promises, you can use the .then syntax</p>
    <fieldset>
      <p>
        <span>Note</span> Make sure you always await the results from the
        promise if you are using async await (if not you may get errors or
        messages saying pending requests) otherwise if you don't want to await,
        you use the .then and the .catch methods
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      Note that a promise returns a value. The two functions that are passed in
      the resolve and reject return values
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const myPromise = new Promise ((resolve, reject) => {
    if (condition === true) {
        resolve("This is good") //Return this if the condition is true
    } else {
        reject("This is bad") //Return this if the condition is bad
    }
})
myPromise.then( (response)=> {
    console.log(response) //The response refers to the data returned from the promise 
    //(either the resolve or reject but in most use cases, the resolve)
}).catch((err)=> {
    console.log(err)
    //The err (error) refers to what was returned from the reject function
})
            </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      Remember that an async function always returns a promise. So when we
      create an async function, we can use the .then and .catch on it
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const getUsers = async () => {
    const users = await axios.get("http://myDataAPI/users");
    //Note that axios also returns a promise so we had to await the response of the promise
    return users
}

getUsers.then((response)=> {
    console.log(response);
    //The response refers to the data gotten from the asynchronous getUsers function
})

const logOutUsers = async () => {
    const users = await getUsers();
    console.log(users)
}
//You see that we awaited the response from the async getUsers function
//Now, we do not have to use the .then and .catch methods
            </pre
        >
        #
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>If we want to do the above with a promise, we will do,</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const myUsers = new Promise ((resolve, reject)=> {
    resolve(axios.get("http://myDataAPI/users"));
});

myUsers.then((response)=>{
    console.log(response);
    //The response still refers to the data gotten from the API
})
            </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
