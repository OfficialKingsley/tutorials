		<h3>The rest and spread operators</h3>
		<p
			>Both operators have the same sign or syntax that is the ellipses sign
			(...) <br />
			It is either called rest or spread depending on when it is used</p
		>
		<p>If it is used when defining a function, then it is called rest</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
const sum = (...numbers) => {
    //code to add numbers
}
                </pre
				>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p
			>In the above it is called the rest operator since it was used in a
			(functionn) definition. <br />Also note that the variable numbers is now
			an array containing all the numbers that the user will enter into the
			function</p
		>
		<p
			>On the other hand, it is called a spread when using it as a value for
			something. It is usually put infront of variables that are arrays</p
		>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6 7, 8]
                </pre
				>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p>
			The spread operator is used when calling a function so it can spread
			across all the values in an array or object or list of values
