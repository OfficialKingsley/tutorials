        <h2>What is a comment?</h2>
        <p>
            A comment is a statement in a code that won't be executed. It is a
            text or little code usually used for reference or for other
            programmers to know the use of the code
        </p>
        <p>
            In JavaScript there are two ways we write comments. We either write
            them as single line comments or multiline comments. <br />
            To make a single line comment we use two backslashes <q>//</q>
            <fieldset>
                <code>
                    let name = "Kingsley" //This is a single line comment
                </code>
            </fieldset>
            <br>
            However, to make a multiline comment, we put the comment in /* This */
            <br>
            <br>
            <fieldset>
                <code>
                    let name = "Kingsley" /*This is a multiline comment as it can <br> span multiple line*/
                </code>
            </fieldset>
        </p>
    </body>
