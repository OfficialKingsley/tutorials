fetch("API") This sends a get request.

  response.json(); The json method converts the data from json
  //We also have the .text(), .
  //These methods also return promises, so we can add other then methods as steps
  //The .json method creates a promise and this promise is then attached to the chain
  //The next
  //The promises returned by the .json() and other methods like that are like when we resolve a promise. So the data from this can then be accessed by the next then method

    <h3>Specifying the type of requests and other options</h3>
    <p>
      By default, the fetch request is making get requests. However, we can
      specify the type of requests of the fetch <br />
      Some of the requests include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GET - This request is made to get data from the api</li>
      <li>POST - This request is made to add data or post data to the api</li>
      <li>DELETE - This is to delete data from the api</li>
      <li>PUT - This request is used to update some data in the api</li>
    </ul>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const res = await fetch("api.link",{
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify( what you want to send)
})
        </pre>
      </code>
