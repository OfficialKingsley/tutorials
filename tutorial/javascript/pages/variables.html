		<h2>Variables in JavaScript</h2>
		<button><a href="intro.html">Back</a></button>
		<button><a href="comments.html">Next</a></button>
		<p>
			A variable can simply be defined as a container for a particular
			information. In javascript, we can declare variables using keywords
			<code>let</code> <code>var</code> and <code>const</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the var keyword is the old way of defining variables so we use the
			let and const
		</p>

		<h3>Difference between let and const</h3>
		The major difference between let and const is that when let is declared, its
		value can be changed but if the variable is declared with const, the value
		can't be changed
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
let name = "Kingsley"; 
const age = 16; 

name = "Oluchi"; //This is a valid re-declaration 

age = 14; //This will result in an error because the const keyword was used
</pre
				>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<h3>Rules for naming in JS</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				It must start with a letter, underscore or a dollar sign but never a
				number
			</li>
			<li>It should not have (mathematical) operators in its name</li>
			<li>
				Naming in javascript is case sensitive therefore,
				<code>liveSpan</code> and <code>livespan</code> are not the same
			</li>
			<li>Javascript keywords cannot be used as variable names e.g. this</li>
			<li>There are no spaces in javascript names</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Declaration and initialization</h3>
		<p> Declaring a variable is giving the variable a name without a value</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>let name;</pre>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p>The above is a declaration</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>let name = "My Name"</pre>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p>Now the above is an initializations</p>
		<p
			>It should however be noted that when using the const keyword, you cannot
			have a declaration instead you can only have an initialization</p
		>

		<h3>Assigning Variable</h3>
		<p
			>A variable can be assigned after it has been declared even if the const
			keyword is used</p
		>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				let name; <br />
				const age; <br />
				name = "My Name"<br />
				age = 37 //Now it can not be reassigned since the const was used
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p
			>I'm pretty sure that you've seen the equal to sign <q>=</q> So often but
			you should note that the equal to sign in JS is known as the assignment
			operator and not an equal to</p
		>
		<p
			>You can make many declarations on the same line by separating them with
			commas</p
		>
		<fieldset> let name, age = "16", car = "Lamborghini"; </fieldset>
		<p
			>Now you see that you don't have to declare all of them using the let
			keyword. This rule also applies for the const and var keywords</p
		>

		<p
			>If a variable is not assigned a value, it has a value of undefined by
			default. <br />
			Also, if you declare a variable after it has been assigned a value, then
			it will still retain its old value</p
		>

		<h3>Operations in strings</h3>
		<p
			>We can perform mathematical operations and assign its value to the string
			e.g.
		</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				let x = 3 + 5 + 7; //Now x has a value of 15 <br />
				console.log(x)
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p
			>We can also add strings but instead of performing mathematical operations
			in concatenates the strings i.e. it puts the strings together to form a
			new string</p
		>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
let age = "1" + "6" //This won't give a value of 7 <br />
console.log(age) //Instead it will give 16 <br />
let name = "John" + " " + "Doe" <br />
console.log(name) //This produces John Doe
</pre>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
