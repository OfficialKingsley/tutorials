    <p>
      Just like you were taught <q>BODMAS</q>, the same applies to JS numbers.
      <br /><br />
      Brackets have the highest precedence <br />
      <br />
      Multiplication and division are of the same precedence <br />
      <br />
      Addition and Subtraction are of the same importance
    </p>
    <h3>Javascript operation order</h3>
    <p>
      You should note that JS executes its code from left to right therefore,
      <br />
      <code>16 + 4 + "Hello" //Will produce "20Hello"</code><br />
      but <br />
      <code>"Hello" + 16 + 4 //Will produce "Hello164"</code>
    </p>
