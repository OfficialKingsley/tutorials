  <body>
    <p>In JS we have two categories of types</p>
    Value types Number String Boolean Symbol Undefined Null
    <p>Reference types Objects, Functions, arrays</p>
    <p>
      Primitives are independent of each other and if one is changed, it doesn't
      affect the other
    </p>
    <p>
      When we use an object, the value of the object is not stored in the
      variable but stored in a reference and the address of the reference if any
      other thing is linked to that reference
