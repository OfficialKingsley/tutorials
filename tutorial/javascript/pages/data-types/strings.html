		<h1>Strings and String Methods</h1>
		<p>
			Anything written in quotes "" is a string. It could be a text, number or
			even an equation or evaluation e.g.
		</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
"A text string" 
"20" //A string that is a number 
var carname = "Volvo XC60";
                </pre
				>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p>
			You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes
			surrounding the string:
		</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
var answer = "It's alright"; 
var answer = "He is called 'Johnny'"; 
var answer = 'He is called "Johnny"';
                </pre
				>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p>
			Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will
			misunderstand this string: <br />
			<code>
<pre>
	var y = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called " and " from the north". 

//The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the \ escape character.
The backslash escape character turns special characters into string characters: 
</pre>
			<code>
				var x = 'It\'s alright'; <br />
				var y = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
			</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The escape character (\) can also be used to insert other special
			characters in a string. This is the list of special characters that can be
			added to a text string with the backslash sign:
		</p>

				<th>Code</th>
				<th>Outputs</th>

			<tr>
				<td>\'</td>
				<td>single quote</td>

				<td>\"</td>
				<td>double quote</td>

		<h2>Strings As Objects</h2>
		<p>
			Strings Can be Objects. <br />
			Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
		</p>
		<fieldset>
			<code>
				<pre>
const name = "Kingsley"
				</pre>
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<p>
			But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword <q>new:</q>
		</p>
		<fieldset class="code">
			<code>var firstName = new String("John")</code>
		</fieldset>
		<fieldset class="code">
			<legend>Example</legend>
			<code>
				var x = "John"; // typeof x will return string<br />
				var y = new String("John"); // typeof y will return object</code
			>
			<fieldset class="note">
				Note: <br />
				Don't create strings as objects as it slows down the execution of code.
				It also complicates code <br />
				(x == y) is true because x and y have equal values <br />
				(x === y) is false because x and y have different types and instances (string and object)
			</fieldset>
			<fieldset class="note">
				Note: Objects cannot be compared: <br />
				<fieldset class="code">
					<legend>Example</legend>
					<code>
						var x = new String("John"); <br />
						var y = new String("John");
					</code>
				</fieldset>

				<code>
					// (x == y) is false because x and y are different objects <br />
					// (x == x) is true because both are the same object
				</code>
			</fieldset>
		</fieldset>
		<h2>String Properties and Methods</h2>
		<p>There is just a slight difference between a property and a method.
			Properties do not have parentheses while methods do. <br>
		Methods are the functions defined in the object while properties are like the characteristics of the object</p>
		<fieldset class="code">
			<code>
				var str = "This is a very nice string" <br />
				console.log(str.length) //Length is a property <br />
				var str1 = se
			</code>
		</fieldset>
		<h3>String Length</h3>
		<p>
			The length of a string is found in the built in property length (.length):
