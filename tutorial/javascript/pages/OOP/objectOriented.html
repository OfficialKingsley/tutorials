        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
        <p>
            This is a <strong>paradigm</strong> (or style) of programming that is centered around objects rather than
            functions
        </p>
        <h2>Pillars of object oriented programming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before object oriented programming, there was procedural programming that had to deal with a lot of
            functions. We had variables and functions separately and is usually the basic of programming language that
            you learn. <br />
            In object oriented programming, we define an object and define functions (known and methods) for the object.
            and we also define variables(known as properties) in the object. The process of doing this is
            <mark><strong>ENCAPSULATION</strong></mark>
        </p>
        <p>From this we can say that functions perform actions whileproperties return values</p>

        For Example,
        <fieldset class="code">
            <legend>Procedural</legend>
            <code>
                let baseSalary = 30000; <br />
                let overtime = 10; <br />
                let rate = 20; <br />
                <br />
                function getWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate) {<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return baseSalary + (overtime + rate); <br />
                }
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="code">
            <legend>Object Oriented</legend>
            <code>
                let employee = { <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baseSalary: 30000, <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overtime: 10 <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate: 20, <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getWage: function() { <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate);
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br />
                }; <br />
                employee.getWage()
            </code>
        </fieldset>

        Abstraction: This involves having some properties that are not going to be in use. This is helpful as these
        parameters can be changedor even deleted and since they were not defined outside the object or were not called
        they do not affect the work flow.

        <p>
            Inheritance: This allows you to eliminate redundant code as an element can inherit properties from a parent
        </p>
        <p>Polymorphism: This helps you get rid of excess conditional statements</p>
