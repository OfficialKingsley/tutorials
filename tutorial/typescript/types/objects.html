        <pre>
const person = {
  name: "Kingsley",
  age: 30
}

console.log(person.nickname) 
//This will give you an error
//It has no nickname value
      </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>If you hover over that person declaration, you see something like</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const person: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      The above is not an object. As you can see the semicolons that are there
      show that it's not an object. <br />
      The above is an object type inferred by typescript. Object types are
      written in key: type pairs with semicolons. They are there to tell what
      type of object and the type of properties and methods it has
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const person: object = { name: "Maximilian", age: 30 }

console.log(person.name) //This will return an errot
//Because we just told types that the type of data
//Is just an ordinary object with no attributes

//The above is the same as
const person: {} = { name: "Maximilian", age: 30 }
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      Also take note that the number of attributes passed in the type has to be
      equal to the number of attributes being assigned else you will get an
      error at compilation
    </p>
    <p>You can then specify the type of values string</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const person: {
  name: string;
} = {
  name: "Kingsley",
  age: 30 //You get an error here at the age
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const person: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
} = {
  name: "Kingsley",
  age: 30
}
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      It is however advised that you allow typescript to infer the type of
      object being passed to a variable
