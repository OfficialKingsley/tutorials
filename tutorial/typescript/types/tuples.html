      This is one of the new types that is added to typescript but is not in
      javascript. It will be compiled to a javascript array <br />
      A tuple can be said to be an array with a definite length and definite
      types
    </p>
    <p>
      For example for some reason you want you want an array that has only two
      elements
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
role = [2, "author"]

//The inference shows
role: (string | number)[]
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>However, this is not the type that we are looking for</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
role.push("admin")
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      The above code will run even though we don't want to add items to the
      array (or tuple)
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
let role: [number, string]
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      The above is therefore setting the type of the data to a tuple. <br />
      We are explicitly setting the datatypes in the array is what is called a
      tuple
    </p>
    <p>
      If you type <code>role.push("admin")</code> this will work because push is
      an exception to tuples even though we have explicitly said that we want
      just two element in the tuple
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
let role: [number, string]

role = [1, "author", "captain"]
//The above will create an error
//So you see that you can't add another item
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
  </body>
