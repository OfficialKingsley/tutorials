    <h2>What is TypeScript</h2>
    <p>
      It is a javascript superset. This means that typescript is a language that
      builds on javascript. It makes writing javascript easier and adds features
      and advantages to it. <br />
      It should however be noted that typescript cannot run on the client side
      or browser and node js also can't execute typescript
    </p>
    <p>
      Typescript is a compiler which compiles into javascript. You write code in
      typescript and then you get an output in javascript. <br />
      Typescript also adds types and helps you to give you extra error checking
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const input1 = document.getElementById("input1")
const input2 = document.getElementById("input2")

function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2
}

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log(add(input1.value, input2.value))
})
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      In the above, you will realize that the function will concatenate because
      the values gotten from an input are always strings no matter the type of
      input it is even if it's of type number. <br />
      The error is not as a result of bad code but however this can be avoided
      in typescript because it is going to give errors there
    </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
npm i -g typescript
        </pre>
