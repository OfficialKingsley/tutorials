# Introduction to MongoDB

Mongo DB is a light weight non-sql database. It is usually used in collaboration with javascript libraries and frameworks to make full stack applications

We're going to be using mongosh which is a terminal (or shell) for running mongo db code

To start with, we type in the command to go into the terminal

`mongosh`

By default, the first thing you see is:

`test>`

That test you see is default name of the database you're using. <br />
Actually that database doesn't exist yet until you put data in it

## Viewing your databases

---

To view your databases you currently have,

<code>
  <pre>
show dbs //Command
