    <h3>Using a database</h3>
    <p>
      In mongo db, you can use a db even if it is not created. It will
      automatically create the database for you when you input data into it
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that in Mongo DB, we have collections(like the tables in the
      database) and we have databases(like in sql)
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>To use a db</legend>
      <code>
        <pre>use dbname</pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>To show collections, we do this</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>show collections</pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      If you are in a database and you want to delete the database, you can just
      type <br />
      <code>db.dropDatabase()</code>
      <code>db.dropCollection() to drop the collection </code> like a Javascript
      code <br />
      However, if we delete a database, we will still appear to be in that
      database but if you type <code>show dbs</code>, you'll see that the
      database is no longer in the list even though we appear to be in that
      database
    </p>
    <p>To get your current database, you type <code>db</code></p>
  </body>
