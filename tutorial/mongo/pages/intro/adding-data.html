      Actually, anything that you store inside mongo db is called a document.
      Documents are in collections and collections in databases <br />
      Since there is no schema, you don't have to worry about the type of data
      you add to your collections
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
db.users.insertOne({name: "Sally", age:19, address: {street: "1982 street"}, hobbies: ["Running"]})
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
//We can insert one item into the db With that function
//The above also created a users collection 
//and added one item (or record) to the collection
//The database also adds an _id to the item added
        </pre>
      </code>
