      Mongoose is an <abbr title="Object Document Mapper">ODM</abbr> which
      stands for object document mapper. <br />
      It allows your node js app which speaks the language of JS objects to be
      able to talk to your mongo DB which speaks in the language of documents
      and collections and the rest <br />
      The main objective of this framework is to simplify the writing of
      validation code, the writing of business logic boiler plate and to make
      the code shorter and easier to work with
    </p>
    <p>Mongoose could be seen as jQuery to Javascript</p>
    <p>First of all, make sure you have an active mongo DB server running</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
const mongoose = require("mongoose")

mongoose.connect("/database-server-url/database-name", { useNewUrlParser: true })
//The above will connect to the database
        </pre>
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>To close a collection with mongoose, we can type this</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
mongoose.connection.close()
        </pre>
      </code>
