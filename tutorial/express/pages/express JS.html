        <h3>Express JS</h3>
        <p>
            This is a web framework for node js. Previously, we used http and file system module to
            set up a web server. With express, it is easier and it does even more
        </p>
        <p>
            Express is a fast, un-opinionated and minimalist web framework for node JS
            <br />
            It's not a high level framework like laravel or django it's very basic at its core. You
            have full control to the
            <br />
            It is backend/ server-side framework. IT's not a client-side framework
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Makes building web applications with node js much easier</li>
            <li>Used for both server rendered apps as well as API/Micro-servers</li>
            <li>Extremely light, fast and free</li>
            <li>Full control of request and response</li>
            <li>Uses JS</li>
            <li>By far the most popular</li>
        </ul>

app.post()
app.put()

app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  //fetch from database
  //Load pages
  //Return JSON
  //Full access to request and response
});

//In express, we also have access to params,
//query strings, url parts as part of the request object etc.

//Express also has a router so we can store routes
//in separate files and export
//We can also parse incoming data with the Body Parser

            Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response object.
            Express has built in middleware but middleware also comes from 3rd party packages <br />
            Execute any code <br />
            Makes changes <br />
            End response cycle <br />
            Call next middleware in the stack
