        h1 This is a heading 1
            span
        p I like the way this paragraph is
            </pre

            If you look at the above, you will see that there are not tags. If you want an element
            inside another, you have to just tab into it. <br />
            In the above, the h1 and p are children of the body tag since they are tabbed into it.
            The span tag is also tabbed into the h1 therefore, the span is a child of the h1 tag
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, you can see in the code above that attributes are added by putting them in
            parentheses and putting them beside the element
        </p>
        <p>You can add a class to an element with the dot operator</p>

        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
h1.title
p.description

input.btn.btn-primary
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>It can also be seen that multiple classes can be added by putting many dots</p>
    </body>
