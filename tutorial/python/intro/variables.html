    <p>Just like other programming languages, python has variables.</p>
    <p>
      Variables are like containers which contain data and can perform functions
      with it
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
name = "Kingsley"

print(name)
#Kingsley
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      As you can see, the python language doesn't need any keywords when
      declaring a variable.
      <br />
      So variables are like adding tags to things. In the above case we added
      the tag of name to the string (anything within quotes) and when we printed
      it out, it came out as Kingsley
    </p>
    <p>
      The print function is an inbuilt function that comes with python to print
      out stuff
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>price = 10</code>When this number ten is stored in the memory of the
      computer is stored in the binary form in the computer. Then the variable
      is attached to it as a label
    </p>
    <h3>Reassigning variables</h3>
    <p>We can also reassign variables</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
value = 10
value = 20
print(value)
#Output: 20
            </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The values of a variable can also be of any data type</p>
    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
price = 10 #(Integer: int)
rating = 4.9 #(Floating point number: float)
name = "Mosh" #(String: str)
is_published = False #(Boolean: Bool)
            </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <h3>Python is case sensitive</h3>
    <p>
      It should be noted that python is case sensitive so False (Which is a
      boolean) is not the same as (false) which is not recognized by python
    </p>
    <h3>Rules for naming variables</h3>
    <p>
      Python variables can have only letters, underscores, numbers and the
      dollar sign.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        use lower cases for your variable names e.g. <code>name, age</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        multiname variables are separated with underscores and not hyphens (-)
        e.g. <code>full_name</code>
      </li>
      <li>Do not start a variable name with a number</li>
      <li>
        Use descriptive names for your variables so that other programmers can
        also understand
      </li>
      <li>5</li>
    </ul>
