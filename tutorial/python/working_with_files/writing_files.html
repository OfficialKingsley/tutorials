            Notice that the second parameter that we passed into the open function was "w" which
            means to write. <br />Note also that the write method overrides what ever is already in
            the file and whatever that was there before will be replaced by this new text
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if the file specified does not exist, it will create the file and write to it
        </p>
