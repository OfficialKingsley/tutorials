      A module is a folder that contains files which contain similar functions
      and other properties. <br />
      These functions can be exported <br />
      You can create your own modules. <br />
      Imagine a supermarket, each section in the supermarket is like a module.
      In each section we could see subsections for particular companies which
      are like the files

        <code>
          <pre>
def say_hi():
    print("Hi")
                    </pre
          >
        </code>
      </fieldset>

        <legend></legend>
        <code>
          <pre>
import new
#import new.py
#you've imported the whole module like an object

new.say_hi() #Hi
                    </pre
          >
        </code>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <code>
          <pre>
from new import say_hi

say_hi()
#Hi
                    </pre

      The advantage of modules is that sometimes you don't have to write all the
      code for some projects. It might be that someone out there has done a
      similar project and might have written a function you want to write. You
      can simply install the person's module and import it into your file
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of modules are hosted online and so you can install them using the
      python pip (which is like npm for node)
