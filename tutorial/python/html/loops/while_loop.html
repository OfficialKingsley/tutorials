      A loop is something that keeps running if a particular condition is true
    </p>
    <p>The while loop runs a block of code while a condition is true</p>

    <fieldset>
      <code>
        <pre>
i = 1
while i &lt; 6:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
                </pre
        >
      </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      If we do not increase the value of i at the end, the loop will keep
      running because the loop will keep running
    </p>
    <p>
      You can break a while loop if some condition is true or you just want to
      terminate the whole loop
    </p>
    <p>
      The while loop can also have an else part which will be executed if the
      whole loop ends without any break statements or without any conditions in
      the code block being met
    </p>

guess_count = 0

while guess_count < guess_limit:
  guess = int(input("Guess: "))
  guess_count += 1
  if guess == secret_number:
    print("Yayy, you won!")
    break

  print("Sorry, you are out of trials")
