        <p>You might want to work with some external files like a spreadsheet or something</p>
        <p>
            For example, if we create a new file in the same directory as our python file, and let's
            name it countries.txt
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
Ghana
Mexico
France
Nigeria
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            To read a file, we call the open function and pass in two parameters. The first
            parameter is the location of the file and the second parameter is what we want to do to
            the file like to read, write, append etc.
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
my_file = open("file", "r")

my_file.close()
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            #In the above, the second parameter is r which means <q>read</q>. <br />
            Other (second) parameters include <br />
            "w" - To write (or edit) the file <br />
            "r+" - To read and write <br />
            "a" - To append to the file ""
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that we also closed the file after we were done with what we were doing. It is
            always good to close the file after you are done with it
        </p>
        <p>
            To check whether the file is readable, you can use the <code>.readable()</code> method
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>python file</legend>
            <code>
                <pre>
countries_file = open("file", "r")

print(countries_file.readable()) #returns True or False

countries_file.close()
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>To reading the first line</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
countries_file = open("file", "r")

print(countries_file.readline()) 
#returns the first line

countries_file.close()
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            Note that we can call the <code>.readline()</code> method many times, everytime we call
            it, it returns the next line <br />
            For example if we call the <code>readline()</code> method 3 times, it is going to return
            the first three lines and for each time we call it, it returns just one line
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
countries_file = open("file", "r")

print(countries_file.readline()) #returns the first line
print(countries_file.readline()) #returns the second line
print(countries_file.readline()) #returns the third line


countries_file.close()
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            However, we can simply get all the lines of the file by using the
            <code>.readlines()</code> method. <br />
            Notice I wrote readlines and not readline <br />
            The <code>.readlines()</code> method returns all the lines in the form of an array.
            Therefore, we can index out the line that we want
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
countries_file = open("file", "r")

print(countries_file.readlines())
#Returns an array of all lines

print(countries_file.readlines()[0])
#prints first line

print(countries_file.readlines()[2])
#prints third line

for line in countries_file.readlines():
    print("line")

countries_file.close()
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
