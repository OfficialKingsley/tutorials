        <p>Just like other programming languages, python has variables.</p>
        <p>Variables are like containers which contain data and can perform functions with it</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
name = "Kingsley"

print(name)
#Kingsley
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            As you can see, the python language doesn't need any keywords when declaring a variable.
            <br />
            So variables are like adding tags to things. In the above case we added the tag of name
            to the string (anything within quotes) and when we printed it out, it came out as
            Kingsley
        </p>
        <p>The print function is an inbuilt function that comes with python to print out stuff</p>
