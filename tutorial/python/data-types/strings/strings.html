        <p>Strings are basically anything within quotes</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
print("Hi, How are you")
#Output: Hi, How are you
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
print("Hi, \nHow are you")
#Output:
Hi, 
How are you
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            Notice that the <q>How are you</q> was placed on a new line and that was because of the
            special character <code>\n</code>. Special characters basically start with a backslash
        </p>
        <p>
            You should note that when using single quotes for your strings, you should not have
            single quotes in there
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
print('He's good')
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            The above will give an error because python will think that you have ended the string
            after He and then treat s and good as variables or something like that <br />
            To avoid this, we can do the following
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
print("He's good")
#Output: He's good
#We used double quotes for the strings

print('He\'s good')
#Output: He's good
#We escaped that ' with the backslash

                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
    </body>
</html>
