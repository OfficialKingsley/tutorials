    <body>
        <p>
            First we open our terminal and we navigate to our desktop <br />
            We make a directory called story <code>mkdir Story</code> <br />
            Then you cd into Story <br />
            make a file called chapter1.txt <br />
            open the file <br />
            Next write something in it
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git init //This will create a local git repository to track our changes

It will create a file called .git (a hidden file that tracks your file)
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            In order to start tracking the changes of your file, you have to add the file to what's
            called a staging area and that is basically an intermediate place where you can choose
            the files in the working directory that you want to commit
        </p>
        <p>
            To see what is currently in your staging area, you can type the command
            <code>git status</code>
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git status
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            Un-tracked files will be shown in red and this is something something in your working
            area but not in your staging area <br />
            In order to add it to the staging area, we have to type the command <code>git add</code>
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git add chapter1.txt


git status will show that chapter1.txt has been added
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>NOw to commit it, you type this</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git commit -m "Git message"
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>You should always use present tense for your git messages</p>
        <p>You can see the commits that you have made by typing the <code>git log</code> command</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git log
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>now we can create more files and make changes to these files</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git status

git add .

//This means add everything in this working directory

git commit -m "We Complete Chapter 2 and three"
//This commits your changes to your local repo

git log
Now we have two different commits 
//and each commit has a unique hash
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>If you make a mistake in your work</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git status

git diff chapter3.txt
This shows the difference between the files

git checkout chapter3.txt
This rolls back chapter3.txt to the last state stored in the local repository
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>If you would like to add a description to your commit, you can type the code below</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git commit -m "The commit message" -m "The decription"
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            The first <code>-m</code> flag is for the commit message and is very compulsory while
            the second is for the description
        </p>
        <p>
            You can actually simply just type the code below to add (or track) the code and then
            commit it. However, it is advised that you actually add and then commit
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git commit -a -m "Commit message"
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
    </body>
