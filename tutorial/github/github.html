        <h3>Connecting your local computer to your github account</h3>
        <p>
            To do this, we'll need what is known as SSH keys. <br />
            We have to first start by typing in a command in the following way: <br />
            <code
                >ssh-keygen -t type-of-encryption -b strength-of-encryption -C
                "github-email-address@email.com"</code
            >
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "example@email.com"
        </pre
                >
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            After this an ssh-key will be generated. <br />
            The default file is in a file (C:/Users/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa). However you can change
            the file where it would be saved <br />
            Next, you pass in a passphrase and repeat the passphrase <br />
            In that folder you will have two keys which are id_rsa and id_rsa.pub <br />
            The one that you are going to upload is the one with the .pub and it is your public key
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a repository on github <br />
            Give it a name and a description <br />
            You can set your repo type to either private or public
        </p>
        <p>
            We can push our local repository to our github repo <br />
            Make sure you copy the link to your github repo
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git remote add origin url_of_your_repo
//This says that our remote repo is called origin

git push -u origin master
This pushes your local repository
//to origin (remote repo) to the master branch
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>
            The reason the -u flag is added is so that the you just type <code>git push</code> when
            you're in the master branch and then it is added to the
        </p>
        <p>
            It should also be noted that if changes are made on github and you would like to get
            those changes from github, you can simply type the command below
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
//If no upstream is set
git pull origin master

//If upstream already set,
git pull
                </pre>
            </code>
