            When you fork a repository, you are making a copy of the someone's code and that copy
            will exist on your own account. At that point, you own it totally and you can make
            changes to it. <br />
            This is different from git clone. In <code>git clone</code>, you actually copy the whole
            repository to your local computer but in this case, we're just copying a repo already
            hosted on github and keeping that copy in our own repo where we can make changes to it
            <br />
            Once you've forked a remote repo, you now own it and you have full permission to do what
            you wanna do with it
        </p>
        <p>
            When you've forked a repo and then you clone it, make changes to it and you push it to
            your local repo; if you would like the real owner of the repository to add your changes,
            then you would have to make a pull request
        </p>
