        <p>Git is what is called a version control system</p>
        <p>Version control is a way we track the changes to our code</p>
        <p>
            Git is the tool that is used for the tracking of the changes while github is a website
            where you host and commit these saves that you make and
        </p>
        <p>A repository is basically a project</p>
        <p>To know if git is installed you can type the command <code>git --version</code></p>
        <h3>Version control</h3>
        <p>
            When you create a project and then you save it on a source control using git and this
            save point is called version 2. <br />
            As you progress, you make more changes and save it as version 2 and then you make
            mistakes with the third one. You can easily access to the previous versions that you
            saved or roll back
