            You might want to try out some new features and commit to another branch and then in the
            future, we can merge the branches to our main project if we find out that our code is
            good and tested
        </p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
cd Story
git log

git branch name-of-branch

git branch //Shows the branches you have

git checkout name-of-plot
//This will switch the branch that you are working on
                </pre>
            </code>
        </fieldset>
        <p>If you would like to merge the branch to the master branch</p>
        <fieldset>
            <code>
                <pre>
git merge branch-name

//This will merge the branch name with the master branch

git push -u origin master

//Now we commit to our remote repository
                </pre>
            </code>
