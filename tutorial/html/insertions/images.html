    <p>In this course we are going to be learning about images in HTML</p>
    <p>To add an image to a page, we use the image element</p>
    <p>
      The alt attribute is used to show a text if the image is not displayed and
      it is important to write good alt text for your images
    </p>
    <p>
      It should also be noted that there is a semantic difference between
      including an empty alt attribute and excluding it altogether. An empty alt
      attribute indicates that the image is not a key part of the content and
      the image is just an additive image that is not necessary to understand
      the rest and thus may be omitted from rendering. However, the lack of an
      alt attribute indicates that the image is a key part of the content and
      that there simply is no textual equivalent available for rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change the width or height of your image using the width and
      height attributes. The width can only be in pixels(px) or percentage(%)
      while the height can only be in pixels
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;img src:"Image URL" alt="Statement if image does not load" width="x%
      or ypx" height="y px" &gt;
    </p>
    <p>The image below has a height of 500px and a width of 500px as well</p>
    <p>
      This is an image <br />
      &lt;img
      src="file:///C:/Users/Kingsley%20Ihemelandu/Pictures/Python%20Levels.PNG"
      width="500px" height="500px" /&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an attribute which is written as srcset. This shows the image to
      use in different situations. e.g. in high resolution displays or in small
      monitors
