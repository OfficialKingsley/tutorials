<h1><u>Tabindex</u></h1>
Value --- Meaning
negative element --- will be focusable, but it should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation<br>
0 element --- will be focusable and reachable through keyboard sequential navigation, but it's relative order is
defined by the platform convention<br>
positive element --- must be focusable and accessible via sequential keyboard navigation; it's relative order will be
defined by the attribute value: the sequential follow the increasing number of the tabindex<br>

<h3><u>Add an element to the tabbing order</u></h3>

<fielset>
    (div tabindex="0)Some button(/div)
</fielset>

<div tabindex="0">Some button</div>

<p>Note: Try to use a native HTML button or an a tag where appropriate.</p>

<h3><u>Remove an element from the tabbing order</u></h3>

<fieldset>
    (button tabindex="-1")This button will not be reachable by tab(/button)
</fieldset>

<button tabindex="-1">This button will not be reachable by tab</button>
The element will be removed from the tabbing order but will still be focusable.

<h3><u>Define a custom tabbing order (not recommended)</u></h3>

<fieldset>
    (div tabindex="2")Second(/div)<br>
    (div tabindex="1")First(/div)
</fieldset>

<div tabindex="2">Second</div>
<div tabindex="1">First</div>
<p>Positive values will insert the element at the tabbing order position of its respective value. Elements without
preference (i.e. tabindex="0" or native elements such as button and a) will be appended after those with preference.</p>
<p>Positive values are not recommended as they disrupt the expected behavior of tabbing and might confuse people
who rely on screenreaders. Try to create a natural order by rearranging your DOM structure.</p>
