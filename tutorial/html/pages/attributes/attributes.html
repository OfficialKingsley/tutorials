    <h2>HTML Attributes</h2>
    <p>
      Attributes are contents within an element that provide more information
      about the element. They often come in name="value" pairs
    </p>
    <br />
    For example, taking a look at the image tag.
    <fieldset>
      &lt;img src="The URL of the image" alt="alternative text"&gt;
    </fieldset>
    <br />
    We can see that there is some additional information like the src
    (attribute) which specifies the path or url of the image and the alt
    (attribute) which specifies an alternative text incase the image is not
    displayed

    <p>
      Also, if we take a look at our first example, we'll see that we put a lang
      attribute in the html tag. The lang attribute defines the language of the
      element (which in this case is the html and therefore the language of the
      document)
    </p>

    <h2>Global Attributes</h2>
    <p>These are attributes that can be used in all html elements</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All html tag names should be written with lowercase</li>
      <li>
        All self closing tags should have trailing commas before the closing of
        the tag
      </li>
      <li>All elements can have attributes</li>
      <li>Attributes should be written in lowercase</li>
      <li>Attribute values should be enclosed in quotes</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
