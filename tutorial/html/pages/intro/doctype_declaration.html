            DOCTYPE declaration
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Here in this program, we used the DOCTYPE declaration to show that we are in HTML 5
        <p>Here, we also used the head tag in the form <"head">...<"/head"></p>
        <p>We also used the body tag which contains all the info that we are writing on the web page.<br>The html tag was used which covers all the tags</p>
    </body>
