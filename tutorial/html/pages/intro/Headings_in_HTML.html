        <strong><u>HEADER TAGS IN HTML</u></strong>
        <p>The header tags are used to show importance or just as used in school notes, they show headings</p>
        <br><h1>Here we have used the h1 tag</h1>
        <br><h2>Here, h2 was used</h2>
        <br><h3>This is h3 and goes on to the h6 tag which will be used next</h3>
        <br><h6>This is the h6 tag</h6>
        <p>It should be noted that all these tags actually have openings and closings.</p>
        <p>We are also going to look at the paragraph (p tag), break(br tag) and pre-formatted tags(pre)</p>
        <br>The break tag (br) is used to show a new line and does not have an ending tag. It can also be seen that there is enough gap when the (br) tag is used
        <pre>This is the pre-formatted tag (pre)...(/pre) It shows that the text was pre-formatted. If you look closely you'll find out that the text looks lighter that the others</pre>
