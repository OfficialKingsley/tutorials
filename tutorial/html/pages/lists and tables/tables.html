        <h1><u>Tables</u></h1>
        The HTML &lt;table> element allows web authors to display tabular data (such as text,
        images, links, other tables, etc.) in a two dimensional table with rows and columns of
        cells.

        <h3><u>Simple Table</u></h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Heading 1/Column 1</th>
                <th>Heading 2/Column 2</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 1 Data Column 1</td>
                <td>Row 1 Data Column 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 2 Data Column 1</td>
                <td>Row 2 Data Column 2</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        This will render a table consisting of three total rows (tr): one row of header cells (th)
        and two rows of content cells (td).<br />
        <"th"> elements are tabular headers and <"td"> elements are tabular data. You can put
        whatever you want inside a <"td"> or <"th">.

        <h3><u>Spanning columns or rows</u></h3>
        Table cells can span multiple columns or rows using the colspan and rowspan attributes.
        These attributes can be applied to <"th"> and <"td"> elements.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>row 1 col 1</td>
                <td>row 1 col 2</td>
                <td>row 1 col 3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="3">This second row spans all three columns</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2">This cell spans two rows</td>
                <td>row 3 col 2</td>
                <td>row 3 col 3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>row 4 col 2</td>
                <td>row 4 col 3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        Note that you should not design a table where both rows and columns overlap as this is
        invalid HTML and the result is handled diﬀerently by diﬀerent web browsers.
        <p>
            rowspan = A non-negative integer that speciﬁes the number of rows spanned by a cell. The
            default value of this attribute is one (1). A value of zero (0) means that the cell will
            extend from the current row until the last row of the table (<"thead">, <"tbody">, or
            <"tfoot">).
        </p>
        <p>
            colspan = A non-negative integer that speciﬁes the number of columns spanned by the
            current cell. The default value of this attribute is one (1). A value of zero (0) means
            that the cell will extend from the current to the last column of the column group
            <"colgroup"> in which the cell is deﬁned.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Column Groups</u></h3>

        <p>
            Sometimes you may want to apply styling to a column or group of columns. Or for semantic
            purposes, you may want to group columns together. To do this, use <"colgroup"> and
            <"col"> elements.
        </p>
        The optional <"colgroup"> tag allows you to group columns together. <"colgroup"> elements
        must be child elements of a <"table"> and must come after any <"caption"> elements and
        before any table content (e.g., <"tr">, <"thead">, <"tbody">, etc.).
        <table>
            <colgroup span="2"></colgroup>
            <colgroup span="2"></colgroup>
            ...
        </table>

        The optional <"col"> tag allows you to reference individual columns or a range of columns
        without applying a logical grouping. <"col"> elements are optional, but if present, they
        must be inside a <"colgroup"> element.
        <table>
            <colgroup>
                <col id="MySpecialColumn" />
                <col />
            </colgroup>
            <colgroup>
                <col class="CoolColumn" />
                <col class="NeatColumn" span="2" />
            </colgroup>
            ...
        </table>
        The following CSS styles can be applied to <"colgroup"> and <"col"> elements: border
        background width visibility display (as in display: none) display: none; will actually
        remove the columns from the display, causing the table to render as if those cells don't
        exist For more information, see HTML5 Tabular data.
        <h3>
            <u>Table with thead, tbody, tfoot, and caption</u>
        </h3>

        <p>
            HTML also provides the tables with the <"thead">, <"tbody">, <"tfoot">, and <"caption">
            elements.
        </p>
        These additional elements are useful for adding semantic value to your tables and for
        providing a place for separate CSS styling.
        <p>
            When printing out a table that doesn't ﬁt onto one (paper) page, most browsers repeat
            the contents of <"thead"> on every page.
        </p>
        There's a speciﬁc order that must be adhered to, and we should be aware that not every
        element falls into place as one would expect. The following example demonstrates how our 4
        elements should be placed.
        <table>
            <caption>
                Table Title
            </caption>
            <!--| caption is the first child of table |-->
            <thead>
                <!--======================| thead is after caption |-->
                <tr>
                    <th>Header content 1</th>
                    <th>Header content 2</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <!--======================| tbody is after thead |-->
                <tr>
                    <td>Body content 1</td>
                    <td>Body content 2</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
                <!--| tfoot can be placed before or after tbody, but not in a group of tbody. |-->
                <!--| Regardless where tfoot is in markup, it is rendered at the bottom. |-->
                <tr>
                    <td>Footer content 1</td>
                    <td>Footer content 2</td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </table>

        <h3><u>Heading scope</u></h3>
        &lt;th> elements are very commonly used to indicate headings for table rows and columns,
        like so:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <th>Column Heading 1</th>
                    <th>Column Heading 2</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Row Heading 1</th>
                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Row Heading 2</th>
                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        This can be improved for accessibility by the use of the scope attribute. The above example
        would be amended as follows:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <th scope="col">Column Heading 1</th>
                    <th scope="col">Column Heading 2</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">Row Heading 1</th>
                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">Row Heading 1</th>
                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            scope is known as an enumerated attribute, meaning that it can have a value from a
            speciﬁc set of possible values. This set includes: col, row, colgroup, and rowgroup
