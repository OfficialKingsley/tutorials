            <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong><br />
            <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a
            <strong>markup</strong> language for designing the basic structure
            of a website and not a programming language. A markup language is
            simply said to be a set of markup tags.

        Enough of all the reading and let's create our first html document
        <fieldset>
            <caption>
                A small HTML document
            </caption>
            <fieldset>
                <code>
                    <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;My First HTML Website&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;My Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                </code>
            </fieldset>
            <button>Try it Out</button>
        </fieldset>
        <p>The example above shows a simple HTML document.</p>
        <h2>DOCTYPE Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            In the above example we saw that the there was a written
            <mark>DOCTYPE</mark>
            This doctype tells the browser what type of HTML document we are
            working with <br />
            <br />
            For HTML 5, it is declared as follows: <br />
        </p>
        <fieldset>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</fieldset>
        <h2>HTML Tags and Elements</h2>
        <p>
            In the above example, we some terms or keywords in angle brackets
            ("&lt;" and "&gt;"). These are known as tags.<br />
            A tag is a keyword (the tag name) enclosed in angle brackets ("&lt;"
            and "&gt;")
            <br />
            Therefore, <br />
            &lt;head&gt; is a (head) tag <br />
            &lt;p&gt; is also a (paragraph) tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            These tags normally come in pairs like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;.
            <br />
            The first tag is called the start tag or popularly known as the
            opening tag and it does not have any slash. &lt;p&gt;<br />
            The second tag on the other hand has a slash before the tag name and
            is called the end tag but more often called the closing
            tag&lt;/p&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            However, some of these do not come in pairs and these are called
            self closing tags. Examples of these tags are:
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;br /&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;img src="" alt="" /&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;hr /&gt;</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            Notice the slash before the closing of the tags. The slash is not required but it is a standard that we at kmavi say you should adopt and follow
        </p>
        <h3>What is an element</h3>
        Taking a look at these paragraph tags
        <br />
        <br />
        <fieldset>&lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;</fieldset>
        <br />
        We'll see that the tags have a content in between them. The combination
        of the tag and the content result in what is known as an element.
